1. `npm i`
2. Dev server: `npm run start`
3. Bundle up JS for production: `npm run production`

Things I would do differently if this was a bigger project:
- JS: I would use Redux and test the code. I would also consider using Flow.
- Styling: I would use sass and structure the styling differently, and I would use another library over Bootstrap.

###Dummy UI
- All correspondences - Calls, tweets, complaints, emails, fraud incidence(s)
  - sub-categories: customer requests, customer complaints, customer relations (this takes you to a section which allows you to view and file complaints/request etc)
- Most important correspondences - These are highlights such as "Top up failed", "fraud detected on card" etc.
