1. `npm i`
2. Dev server: `npm run start`
3. Bundle up JS for production: `npm run production`


Things I would do differently if this was a bigger project:
- JS: I would use Redux. I would also consider using Flow.
- Styling: I would use sass and structure the styling differently, and I would use another library over Bootstrap.
